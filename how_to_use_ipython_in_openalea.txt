To use IPython with VisuAlea or LPy,
you have to download and install IPython in a special way.


/!\ You need a GitHub account.

You have to:

- go to https://github.com/epatters/ipython
- "fork"
- clone in local forked repository (with "Git Gui" or in command line)
- checkout the branch "origin/embedded-ipython-v2"
- check if "ipython\docs\examples\frontend\inprocess_qtconsole.py" exists
- if it exists continue, else check in GitHub if you have really forked the repository
- install ipython (in command line: "python setup.py")


Congratulation! You have IPython in VisuAlea and Lpy!
