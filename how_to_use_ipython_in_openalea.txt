To use IPython with VisuAlea or LPy,
you have to install IPython >=1.0.

=============================================
The easiest way is to use easy_install:
$ easy_install ipython[all]
That's all...
=============================================

If you prefer, you can use develop version.
You have to:

$ git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
$ cd ipython
$ python setup.py install

If you want to be able to follow the development branch as it changes. If you have distribute installed, this is easy. Simply replace the last step by:
$ python setupegg.py develop

This creates links in the right places and installs the command line script to the appropriate places.

Then, if you want to update your IPython at any time, just do:
$ git pull

If you want to change branch:
to branch 0.13.x:
$ git checkout 0.13.x
to branch 1.x:
$ git checkout 1.x
to branch HEAD:
$ git checkout master

After checkout, don't forget to re-do "python setup.py install" or "python setuegg.py develop"

( more details: 
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html
and http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version )

In some cases, you may have to install ipython dependencies too: zmq and pygments.
You can do it like that:
$ easy_install pyzmq            (for zmq)
$ easy_install pygments         (for pygments)




Congratulation! You have IPython in VisuAlea and Lpy!
