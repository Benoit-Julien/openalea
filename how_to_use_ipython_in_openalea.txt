To use IPython with VisuAlea or LPy,
you have to download and install developping version of IPython.

You have to:

$ git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
$ cd ipython
$ python setup.py install

If you want to be able to follow the development branch as it changes. If you have distribute installed, this is easy. Simply replace the last step by:

$ python setupegg.py develop

This creates links in the right places and installs the command line script to the appropriate places. Then, if you want to update your IPython at any time, just do:

$ git pull


( more details: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version )



You may have to install ipython dependencies too: zmq and pygments.
You can do it like that:
$ easy_install pyzmq            (for zmq)
$ easy_install pygments         (for pygments)

Congratulation! You have IPython in VisuAlea and Lpy!
