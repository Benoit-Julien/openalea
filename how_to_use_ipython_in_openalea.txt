To use IPython with VisuAlea or LPy,
you have to download and install developping version of IPython.

You have to:

- go to https://github.com/ipython/ipython
- download zip
- unzip
- install ipython (in command line: "python setup.py")

You may have to install ipython dependencies too: zmq and pygments.
You can do it like that:
- easy_install pyzmq            (for zmq)
- easy_install pygments         (for pygments)

Congratulation! You have IPython in VisuAlea and Lpy!
